Hey there!

This is the repository to our Data Science for all - Colombia 2022 (DS4A) Bootcamp's capstone project. The name of the project was "A Look at Health Care in Sogamoso, Boyac√°" and we carried it out with data provided directly by Sogamoso's Health Secretariat. Six people were involved in this project (DS4A's team 222), so I (Aura) thought that, since this is my personal GitHub, the fairest thing was to only share the notebooks corresponding to the parts of the project that were assigned to me or where I was heavily involved in (some of the data cleaning and EDA, as well as the models). The other notebooks are hidden.

A detailed description of the whole project and our results are in the file "Team222_Report.pdf" (you might need to download it). You also might want to see the datafolio (Team222_Datafolio.pdf). Regarding my participation, please especially review the following sections since they will give context to the notebooks I'm sharing:

    3.1 Cleaning the Data
    3.3 Exploring the Data, and
    4. The Model

but feel free to check the whole report in order to have a general understanding of the project.
